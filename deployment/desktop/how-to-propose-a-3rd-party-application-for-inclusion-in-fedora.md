### Getting it into Fedora Workstation

You now have your repository created and ready for users to connect to it. The final step is getting your repository added to Fedora Workstation.

To start the process for this you can file a [Fedora ticket](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora) against the *fedora-workstation-repositories* component. The information needed is a decription of your application. We also need the URL where the repository is located.

This will allow the Fedora Workstation Working group to review your application and ask any needed follow-up questions. For more in depth-information about the process and rules for including 3rd party software in Fedora Workstation you can see the [Third Party Software for Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/Third_party_software_proposal) page.
